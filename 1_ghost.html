      <p>Mr Basil had gathered all of the guests in the Dining Room for a ritual to summon his late wife. 
  The ritual required everyone to hold hands together in order to communicate with Mrs Basil. 
  Mrs Basil would answer by making a rapping sound under the table. One rap for yes. two raps for no. 
  At the end, Mr Basil was pleased to have spoken to his late wife and finally found peace through the process.. or was it just a hoax? 
  Find out which of the suspects was the fake ghost. 
  (Hint: It has to be someone whose hand is free to use their weapons to making the rapping sound!).

      <p>The guest were all carrying their weapons throughout the ritual</p>
<p>Doctor Melon: "I had the Knife with me as I had forgotten to leave it in my room before coming down. I was holding on to Mrs Blank's and Miss Rose's hands until I let go of the latter's for a brief moment to scratch my foot."</p>
<p>Mr Leaf: "I had the Steel Rod with me. I was holding on to General Lemon's hand and that fellow kept complaining that I was holding onto it so tightly that he challenged me to a duel. Pmft! Oh, and I was holding Mr Basil's hand too."</p>
<p>General Lemon: "Yeah, I had the Spanner. Stupid Mr Leaf and his grip!"</p>
<p>Mrs Rainbow: "I brought along the Rope just in case we needed it. And I was holding onto General Lemon's hand. Such a big hand he has."</p>
<p>Miss Rose: "Don't ask me why I had the Pistol. I am just cautious like that. But I felt safe having Mr Basil beside me and holding my hand."</p>
<p>Mrs Blank: "I brought the Candlestick as I was afraid the Dining Room's lights will blow again. Doctor Melon has really sweaty palms!"</p>

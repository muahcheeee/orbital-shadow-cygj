<p>Mr Basil had just told his six favourite guests that he has left a will for all of them. As there is no living heir to the Basil fortune worth millions of dollars, after Mr Basil dies, the money will be divided evenly among the six guests. However, to the guests dismay, Mr Basil exclaimed that he does not have any intent of dying so soon and plans to live a long long life. The next morning, Mr Basil was found dead in the Library. Follow the series of conversation to determine who is the murderer.

<p>Doctor Melon: "Yes. But only to borrow a book on butterfly collecting. Mr Basil was alive and well at the time. I might add, I was there before you, Mrs Rainbow."</p>
